# SCLC-Commentary

*Accompanying paper:*
Evaluating the prognostic value of mutational signatures in small-cell lung cancer through data-driven threshold optimization and signature assignment

*Order of running code:*
Data-Import-and-Cleaning.R -> Functions.R -> Main-Analysis.R -> Plots.R -> Figures.R

*Needed files:*
Download deconstructSigs_1.8.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/raerose01/deconstructSigs/releases in order to assign signatures with deconstructSigs.

Run Bootstrap_calculations.R with num_bs = 1000 in order to replicate the bootstrap optimal cutoffs.
